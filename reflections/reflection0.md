Focus on the process of team formation and creating your first sprint backlog. For example, how did you each share your individual goals and combine them to form team goals? How did your team decide on a scrum master and divide other responsibilities? How did you decide what to include and omit from your sprint backlog? What are you still apprehensive about?


#### Individual Goals
We formed a team together because we had similar levels of experience and similar goals: we are all new to C and primarily want to learn C. We decided to focus our project on threading because team members showed interest and it's a flexible space (there's an achievable MVP and plenty of room for further exploration if we have time).

#### Division of Responsibilities
Scrum master went to Hannah, who hadn't been scrum master before and was willing to be. Other responsibilities are not really divided; we're all doing all of the readings, reading ahead about threading, and researching potential projects approximately equally.

#### Sprint Backlog
We included pretty much everything on our sprint backlog. We have two columns for todo: project and readings/exercises. The project column is where we place things to do that are specific to our project.

#### Concerns
I'm still a little apprehensive about the vagueness of this project combined with my complete lack of background in C, but I'm reasonably confident that we'll be fine.
