# Exercise 2
## Pointers


1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
expected?

'stack.c' is intended to print 42 fives times.

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?

Yes, function returns address of local variable. This is because foo() returns array, which is a pointer to the array you created inside foo(), which is unavailable once the function finishes execution.

3.  Run it.  What happens?  Can you explain it?  You might find it
helpful to draw a stack diagram.

When you run 'stack.c', it breaks and gives you a message 'Segmentation fault (core dumped)'. This is because it's trying to access the address of a variable local to foo(), which is unavailable now.

4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run
it again.  What happens now?

I'm not sure whether these were supposed to be commented in the beginning, but when the print statements are commented, there is a compile warning and running it causes a segmentation fault. When the print statements are not commented, there is a compile warning and running it prints the addresses of the arrays in the stack and then causes a segmentation fault.

5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results,
then check the code in to the repo.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!
