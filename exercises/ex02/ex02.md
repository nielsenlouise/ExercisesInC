# Exercise 2
## Pointers


1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
expected?

`stack.c` is intended to print 42 fives times.

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?

Yes, function returns address of local variable. This is because `foo()` returns array, which is a pointer to the array you created inside `foo()`, which is unavailable once the function finishes execution.

3.  Run it.  What happens?  You might get a segmentation fault, or you might get
some strange output.  Can you explain it?  You might find it helpful to draw a stack diagram.

When you run `stack.c`, it breaks and gives you a message `Segmentation fault (core dumped)`. This is because it's trying to access the address of a variable local to `foo()`, which is unavailable now.

4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run
it again.  What happens now?

I'm not sure whether these were supposed to be commented in the beginning, but when the print statements are commented, there is a compile warning and running it causes a segmentation fault. When the print statements are not commented, there is a compile warning and running it prints the addresses of the arrays in the stack and then causes a segmentation fault.

5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results,
then check the code in to the repo.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!
